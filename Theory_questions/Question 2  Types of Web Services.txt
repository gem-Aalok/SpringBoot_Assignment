Question 2 : Types of Web Services (SOAP, REST) and Differences
Ans : 

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):

Think of SOAP as a formal, structured way of sending messages
-> It uses XML, a language that's very strict about how data is formatted
-> known for its robust security features and transaction support
-> It is generally considered more complex and heavyweight

REST (Representational State Transfer):

-> REST is more like a casual conversation. Its simpler and more flexible
-> It often uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is easier for humans and machines to read.
-> It provides HTTP methods to peform CRUD operations on resources
-> Its known for its scalability and performance.
-> Its generally considered more lightweight and easier to work with.

Key Differences:

Data Format: SOAP uses XML, REST often uses JSON
Complexity: SOAP is more complex, REST is simpler
Performance: REST is generally faster and more scalable
Flexibility: REST is more flexible than SOAP
