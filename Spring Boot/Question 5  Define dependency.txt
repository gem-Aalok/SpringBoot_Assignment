Question 5 : Define dependency injection and its importance in Spring framework
Ans :
Dependency Injection is a design pattern where Spring injects dependencies into a class rather than allowing the class to create them

Take it as like : instead of building a car engine into the car yourself, you get a pre-built engine and install it\

Importance of DI in spring
-> Loose coupling : reduce depencies between classes , increase modularity
-> Reusability : classes become more modular and dont depend on specific implementation
-> Easier Testing : Helps in easy testing with mock dependencies
-> Better Maintainability : enhances code reusability and readability
